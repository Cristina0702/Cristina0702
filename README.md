### Hi there 👋

- 🎲 I'm specialising in the field of Reinforcement Learning for multi-agent partially observable stochastic games (POSG) with large discrete action spaces
 
- 🏫 I'm currently pursuing a Master of Science (by Research)
- 👩‍🎓 I recently graduated with a First-Class Honours in the Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence degree
- 📔 I recently published the paper titled "Mastering the Card Game of Jaipur Through Zero-Knowledge Self-Play Reinforcement Learning and Action Masks." at the AIxIA 2023 conference (22nd International Conference of the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence)

Some fun facts about me:
- 📅 I'm 21 years old
- 🇲🇹 I live in Malta
- 💻 I really love dogs and programming :)
